# Overview

This is a program that repersents a Rubiks cube program in c++. It only shows one side at a time, but you can move each side of the cube
like how you would if you had an actual Rubik's cube in your hands. 

I use visual studio's to code this. 

My purpose was to learn C++ and to be able to demonstrate a complex object using this language. 

I was not able to get this to run completly yet. I have been having an error that says that I have a 'class' type redefinition. I did not know how to fix it. I have all of the code writen up but I could not figure out what that meant. 

# Development Environment

I used Visual studio. It has a IDE for C++, that allows it to be displayed on the console. 

I used Iostream library, This has all of the basic c++ functions.
I then used the vector library. I used vectors to represent each side of the cube and each squares on the cube.
I then used string which gives me access to string types in c++
I also used unordered_map library. I used this so that I could use a switch statement for when the user wanted to have something displayed and the movement of the sides for the cube.

# Future Work

- Figure out why I have that error.
- I Realized the movement was all based off of the white side facing you. If I want it to work better I need it to more optimal to it switching sides. 
- Eventually allow users to view all 6 sides of the cube.
